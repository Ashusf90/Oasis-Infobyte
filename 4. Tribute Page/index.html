            <h2>Revolutionary Impact</h2>
            <p>
                What I admire most about Steve Jobs is his unwavering commitment to excellence and his ability to see beyond what exists to imagine what could be. He didn't just create products; he created experiences that changed how we interact with technology. His famous quote, "Stay hungry, stay foolish," embodies his philosophy of constant innovation and risk-taking.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jobs had an incredible gift for understanding what people wanted before they knew they wanted it. The iPhone revolutionized communication, the iPod transformed how we consume music, and the Macintosh made computers accessible and beautiful. He proved that technology and art could merge seamlessly.

            <h2>A Lasting Legacy</h2>
            <p>
                Steve Jobs' impact extends far beyond the products he created. He taught the world that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication, that innovation requires saying no to a thousand things, and that the journey is as important as the destination. His Stanford commencement speech remains one of the most inspirational talks ever given.
            </p>
            <p>
                His ability to connect technology with liberal arts created products that weren't just functional, but magical. He showed that business could be about more than profit—it could be about making a dent in the universe. His legacy lives on in every iPhone user, every animated film, and every entrepreneur who dares to think different.
